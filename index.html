    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Colin Brooks. I am a self-taught Python programmer with an academic background in finance & investing. 
        I have worked in commercial banking as a credit analyst and underwriter for the past four years and have been pursuing the CFA Charter for the investing industry.
        In the pursuit of career development, I have been looking to break into the tech industry which has spurred my enrollment into the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp in order to learn full-stack development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the past couple of years I have been teaching myself about artificial intelligence with deep learning & neural networks.
        Lately my personal side-projects have included the exploration of unsupervised learning for the purposes of stock trading using a customizes OpenAI Gym environment.
        I also am a co-founder and owner of a cryptocurrency mining company located in Melbourne, FL.
